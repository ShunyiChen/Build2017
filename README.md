# The REST API for Integrating TFE and TRUcore
Expanding TFE integration
We will build a RESTful Web Service to expand the TFE integration with the TPA SDK and microservices using Spring,Spring Boot and Spring Cloud, so that to increase the services for mobile phone, tablet or some other existing systems to access. Take mobile phone for example, using the phone, the TFE user can send files to or receive files from internal users, and send files to external partners such as suppliers.
